# **PatchGuardBypass**

I've had the delightful opportunity to research PatchGuard for the past couple of weeks. It was fun at times.

I'll be writing a "research paper" about my experience and my findings, hopefully it could help anyone else who's hesitant to do something like this :)

In the meantime, I'll also be writing a dynamic PatchGuard bypass for modern Windows 10 systems.
Hopefully when it's done it'll include 3 main features:

## **Disable**
Disables PatchGuard completely and prevents its execution.

## **Evade** 
Evades PatchGuard detection by reverting patches prior to the PG check times.

## **Verify**
Checks if PatchGuard has been disabled on the system. Basically the opposite of Disabling.

**The feature names are WIP, do not roast me for the poor choice <3**
