# **PatchGuardBypass**

I've had the delightful opportunity to research PatchGuard for the past couple of weeks, and it was mostly pretty fun.

I'll be writing a paper about my experience and my findings, hopefully it could help anyone else who's hesitant to do something like this :)

In the meantime, I'll also be writing a dynamic PatchGuard bypass for modern Windows 10 systems. This is still a bit far from done, so please don't expect anything to work at this stage.
Hopefully when it is finished it'll include 3 main features:

### **Disable**
Disables PatchGuard completely and prevents its execution.

### **Evade** 
Evades PatchGuard detection by reverting patches prior to the PG check times.

### **Verify**
Checks if PatchGuard has been disabled on the system. Basically the opposite of Disabling.

**DISCLAMER: The feature names are work-in-progress, do not roast me for the poor choice <3**
